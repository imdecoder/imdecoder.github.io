### Summary

With 8+ years backend-end PHP experience with part of front-end experience and half year full stack experience, I am now looking for a full stack or front-end opportunity to learn and gain more experience on frameworks development.

I am a fast and keen learner with a good attention to details and excellent troubleshooting skills. I am also a good team player who has a proven ability to work analytically. I am highly efficient, deadline focused, and handle multiple projects at same time.
