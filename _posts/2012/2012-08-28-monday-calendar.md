[Monday Calendar][1] is a day based todo app which is similar with [Teuxdeux][2], but it has better interface(at least for me), works on iPhone/iPad as well with browser, and more functions coming.

Usually, I use [Omnifocus][3] as my project GTD app, and it is still the best GTD app for Mac, iPhone, and iPad.

However, sometimes I just need a simple list app especially for my work. I tried [Monday Calendar][1] one day, and I feel this is what I am looking for. Simple, clearly, easy, and with elegant interface.

It's worth to try, and I think you will like it. Go [website][1] and request invite now.
