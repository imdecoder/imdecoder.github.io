I have re-installed my Macbook Pro with Mac OS X Lion.

And I did another research to enhance terminal prompt to make it get better looking.

What I need:

- seperate each command part
- show git branch
- colors

You can get it from [**here**](https://github.com/imjma/dotfiles/blob/master/.bash_profile)
